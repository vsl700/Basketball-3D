A 3D basketball simulator, where the user plays with his bot teammates against a bot team. The simulator is written entirely in Java and it uses the game library libGDX, as well as some of its extensions, like Bullet for
the 3D physics and gdxAI for the AI of the basketball players.

## Game modes
Basketball-3D offers 3 gamemodes:
- <b>Normal Game</b>, where the user plays a basketball match with his team of bots against a bot team. In this gamemode the user can select the amount of players per team (from 1 to 5), as well as the difficulty of the game (Easy, Hard and Very Hard). The difficulties basically enable or disable basketball rules and weaken or strengthen bots difficulty. A match ends whenever one of the two teams reaches 15 points or all players from a team (or the main player) get disqualified.
- <b>Tutorial Levels</b>, where the user can learn everything about how to play on the simulator and also about basketball itself, all thanks to Basketball-3D's interactive tutorials.
- <b>Challenge Levels</b>, which is basically like <b>Normal Game</b>, but with some challenges, like "Playing Until Time Runs Out", "Play Alone In Your Team" etc., which can be combined in one game and also the user can select challenge options, which determine for example how long the game will go (for "Playing Until Time Runs Out").
